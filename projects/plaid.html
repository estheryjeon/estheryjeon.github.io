      <h1>Plaid Migration</h1>
      <p class="caption">
        Betterment, 2021
      </p>
      <p>
        Betterment's bank aggregator, Quovo, was acquired by Plaid so, first and foremost, we had to make the great migration to Plaid. 
        This transition gave us a great opportunity to visually update the bank connecting experience, clarify the process and benefits, and become more transparent.

        <h1>Problem</h1>
        <p>
            There were a couple issues we wanted to tackle:
        </p>
        <ul class="points">
            <li>Bank connections broke frequently and balance updates were unpredictable on Quovo</li>
            <li>Small banks were often unavailable on Quovo</li>
            <li>It wasn't clear that there is a manual account connection option</li>
            <li>Funding accounts were confusing</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="img-caption">This was the experience with Quovo.</p>
        <p>
            I want to note that the first two issues were resolved just by using Plaid! So I'll be going over the last two issues in this case study.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="container">
        <h1>Design</h1>
        <p>
            Based on our current experience and where we want to go with the Plaid updates, I created a flow to figure out the steps at a higher level. 
            We have different logic based on where the customer enters the flow so I wanted to make sure I captured that, seeing what steps are similar 
            and where they differ.
        </p>
        <img src="../assets/plaid/chart.png">
        <p class="img-caption">Lots of lines and arrows!</p>
        <p>
            From here, I started designing the main steps: intro, connected accounts, and selecting a funding account.
        </p>

    <section class="container">
        <h1>Testing</h1>
        <p>
            Before we get to the design iterations, I wanted to mention some early user testing.
            I started testing my designs really early to get some general feedback and comprehension.
            I wasn't sure if this was a common flow that people were used to on other financial apps.
        </p>

        </video>
        <p class="img-caption">Looking back now, the information in this iteration wasn't super clear. But I learned!</p>
        <p>
            I quickly learned that people were used to connecting their banks to financial apps.
            Most of the user testers had no issues getting through it. 
            Some did have some qualms about giving their financial data, but they were able to find the manual option pretty easily.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="container">
        <h1>Intro</h1>
        <p>
            The intro went through quite a few iterations.
            For a bit of background, here are the types of connections you can make:
            <ul class="points">
                <li>Instant connections through Plaid<br>
                    <span class="paragraph">You connect your bank accounts with your bank credentials. This gives us the most accurate data on your finances. </span>
                </li>
                <li>Manual connections<br>
                    <span class="paragraph">You enter an account and routing number and verify a micro-deposit. We get no real time data on this account.</span>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            We wanted to prioritize the instant connection through Plaid because we were able to get the most accurate data and give a holistic 
            view of your finances.
            We didn't want to discourage a manual connection because some times that's the only option for a bank, but we didn't want to have it 
            on the same level as instant.
        </p>

        <p>
            I ended up with this direction. This captured the main benefits of an instant connection. 
            And the manual connection was right below as a tertiary link if you needed it. This solved our issue of clearing up the manual account option. Hooray!

        <h1>Connected accounts & funding accounts</h1>
        <p>
            After connecting on Plaid, we show you a summary of the accounts you connected.
            Here are some iterations I did based on customer feedback on the existing Quovo experience.
        </p>
        <ul class="points">
            <li>Unclear what account was connected because the names often came back weird<br>
                <span class="paragraph">
                    I tried to see if we could get the name of the account as it appears for customers' in their bank app.
                    Unfortunately, this was pretty inconsistent and hard to get from Plaid.
                    <span class="spacer-s"></span>
                    <img src="../assets/plaid/post-1.png">
                </span>
            </li>
            <li>Some customers only wanted to connect some accounts<br>
                <span class="paragraph">
                    In this iteration, I gave the option to deselect some accounts to hide.
                    This doesn't mean we don't connect the account, but we ignore it from the Betterment side.
                    This one was out of scope.
                    <span class="spacer-s"></span>
                    <img src="../assets/plaid/post-3.png">
                </span>
            </li>
            <li>Funding accounts were unclear <br>
                <span class="paragraph">
                    This is one of the main issues and I tried to resolve it by combining two steps:
                    showing the connected accounts and selecting funding accounts.
                    I got feedback that this wasn't very clear and transparent on what was connected.
                    <span class="spacer-s"></span>
                    <img src="../assets/plaid/post-2.png">
                </span>
            </li>
        </ul> 
        <p>
            I ended up splitting the steps so we show you the connected accounts first and then ask which one you want to use as a funding account.
            This resolved our funding accounts clarity issue!
        </p>

        <p class="img-caption">This makes sure the customer understands what accounts they connected and what data we have.</p>

        <img src="../assets/plaid/post-final-2.png">
        <p class="img-caption">This step was able to clarify which accounts you can use as your funding account.</p>

        <p>
            This was a pretty huge project. Our team worked on this for months to make the transition smooth for our customers.
            There were some tech constraints and challenges, but I was able to work with our lead engineer to figure out a solution that works conceptually and technically. 
            I'm pretty proud of how the experience ended up and the impact we had on our customers behind the scenes!
            I was also very excited to have updated our flows with current components and styles.
