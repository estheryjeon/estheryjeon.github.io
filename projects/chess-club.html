    <h2>Chess Club</h2>

      Primer, 2022
    </p>
    <p>
      Primer was originally a space for kids to pursue their passions through clubs. 
      Kids could join various interest-based clubs on our platform like Naturalists and Gamers. 
      We started exploring 3rd-party led clubs and found Chess4Life. 
      We partnered with them to create a Chess Club on Primer.

    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>
      Many of the most popular chess platforms aren’t kid-friendly.
      For example, Lichess is one of the best chess platforms, but they don’t have spaces for kids to discuss and play with each other. The internet can be a scary place! 
      Chess4Life got around it by creating accounts for every kid in their classes and putting them on “kid-mode” that limited all chat and social features on Lichess. 
      This isn’t an ideal solution and not as exciting for kids to interact with. But Primer was well-positioned to tackle this problem as an online space only for kids.

    <p class="img-caption">Lichess had a kid mode where you couldn't chat for safety reasons,

    <h3>Design</h3>
    <p>
      I’m not a chess player so I learned a lot of chess design from Lichess and Chess.com. 
      I started playing more and solving puzzles to figure out what’s intuitive and what’s not. 
      It was a pretty fun way to learn about the problems, but also very hard! Chess is not an easy game…
    </p>
    <p>
      In phase 1, we built the basic features of a chess platform: playing a friend and computer, chess profile, and chess tournaments.

    <p>
      So, what did we build that was different from Lichess? 
      What did I have to consider from the kid platform lens? There are two things!

      <h3>1. Integrating chess with Primer's features</h3>
      <p>
        Primer already had social features like rooms, channels, and profiles for kids. 
        We wanted to see how chess could live in those systems.
        Kids could now play chess in a room, while chatting with their opponent! 
        Spectators could also join to watch games. Lichess could never.

     <h3>2. A club for all levels: beginners to experts</h3>
     <p>
      We wanted Chess club to be for all levels. 
      The future ideal state was to create guides with Chess4Life for kids to learn chess in the club as well.
      We were only able to get to a little onboarding before we closed the club,
      but we hoped to use this onboarding survey to understand what kind of content to create.

      <h3>Testing</h3>
      <p>
        We tested tournaments a few times with the Chess4Life classes. 
        It went smoothly! Kids enjoyed the ability to chat (maybe a little too much) and explored rooms.
        We then started doing weekly tournaments with Chess4Life and Primer kids, with prizes!
        Our first winners below :~)

      <h3>Iterations</h3>
      <p>
        There were still a few problems:
        <ul class="points">
          <li>Kids had trouble finding someone to play with outside of tournaments</li>
          <li>Kids often navigated away from games and lost track of it</li>
          <li>We still needed to figure out how to differentiate ourselves from established platforms like Lichess and Chess.com</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some ideas I designed to solve said problems:
        <ul class="points">
          <li>Correspondence chess
            <span class="spacer-s"></span>
            <img src="../assets/chess/correspondence.png" alt="">
            <p class="img-caption">You have a much longer time to make a move so if you leave your computer, it's no problem.</p>
          </li>
          <span class="spacer-s"></span>
          <li>Better notification system
            <span class="spacer-s"></span>
            <img src="../assets/chess/notifications.png" alt="">
            <p class="img-caption">Tournament notifications at the top within Chess club and active game notifications globally on the side bar.</p>
          </li>
          <span class="spacer-s"></span>
          <li>Leveraging rooms for unique chess experiences
            <span class="spacer-s"></span>
            <img src="../assets/chess/puzzle-race.png" alt="">
            <p class="img-caption">Puzzle racer is a classic game, but in a room, it would be so much more exciting!</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Unfortunately, we didn't get to these as Chess club came to a close.</p>

    <h3>Learnings & reflection</h3>
    <p>
      We stopped our partnership with Chess4Life after a few months as we felt that the opportunity was hard to grow for our team at the moment.
      As we started moving towards microschools, we had to deprioritize the club.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I first got asked to design a chess club, I was like uhhh, I don't know anything about chess?
      But it ended up being one of my favorite projects! Learning chess was really fun. And creating a digital environment
      for kids to play a game is quite a different way of thinking from designing social and educational features.
      Chess is a game everyone can play. That allowed me to empathize on a deeper level as I played chess,
      experiencing firsthand the best and worst parts of online chess.
      It's a good sign when most of the features you design are features you want to use.

      I also unlocked a new skill: designing 3D chess pieces on Illustrator.
      I felt so powerful?
