            I made some art in college and I really loved it. Here are a few of my favorites ~

        <img src="../assets/art/felt.gif" alt="A gif of layers of semi-transparent papers.">
        <p class="caption">
            I was fascinated by transparency, layers, and light during my senior thesis.
            There's something about the three qualities that evoke nostalgia.
            I experienced many new things in college and I explored and reflected on them
            through these layers.

        <img src="../assets/art/tokyo.jpg" alt="A photo of 5 photos in Tokyo.">
        <p class="caption">
            In 2019, I got the chance to go to Tokyo, Japan to make a body of photographic work.
            <span class="spacer-s"></span>
            My artist statement for the exhibition: <br>
            After wandering around Tokyo, I noticed the awkward, suffocating spaces in between many buildings. 
            After spending time with and photographing those spaces, I began inverting my impressions. 
            Those spaces slowly became breathing spaces, and a small window into life beyond my current location, a look into another space of the city. 
            I started to smile when I saw those quiet, uninhabited spaces tucked away amidst the hectic city â€“ discovering Tokyo in a new light.

        <img src="../assets/art/street-view.jpg" alt="A grid of photos of people from Google Street View.">
        <p class="caption">
            In my photography class, I explored alternatives to image-making beyond taking photos.
            I found Google street view. And I created so many portraits of people in so many places.
            Just hours of searching around and looking for people looking at the camera.

        <img src="../assets/art/rejection.gif" alt="A gif of a zine about job rejection emails.">
        <p class="caption">
            After getting countless rejections in college, I made a zine about how to write one as a coping mechanism and as a way to move past them and keep persevering.
            Here's a digital version: <a class="caption-link" href="https://estheryjeon.com/rejection-generator/">Rejection email generator</a>.

        <img src="../assets/art/sakura.gif" alt="A pink zine about Sakura from the anime Naruto.">
        <p class="caption">
            I made a zine series about the iconic anime, Naruto. 
            This one is about Sakura, understandably dismissed for annoyance, but comes through in the end.
            Lots of mixed feelings here.
