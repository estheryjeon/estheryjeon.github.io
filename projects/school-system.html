        <p>
            Primer is creating a new way to school and that means there are unique needs.
            We needed a student information system (a platform that manages student data, grades, roster, etc.), that did more than just student data.
            We needed a system that supported the whole school community: students, educators, and families.
            After researching different SIS (and even going on a few calls with sales representatives), we found that nothing quite solved our use case. 
            Many of them were also outdated and clunky. 
            So we made our own!
